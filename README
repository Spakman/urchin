A Unix shell for Ruby programmers. Regard this as very incomplete and
experimental for now!

What works?
===

Pipelines:

	ls -la | head -n2

Redirecting STDOUT, STDIN, STDERR:

	uptime > output
	uptime >> output
	ruby -e 'puts STDIN.read; STDERR.puts 33' < source > out_and_err 2>&1

Backgrounding jobs:

	sleep 60 &

Multiple jobs:

	sleep 60 & man sleep

	sleep 60; echo "it's over"

Quoted and unquoted parameters:

	grep -r '"hello"' .
	grep -r "\"hello\"" .
	ls my\ annoyingly\ named\ dir
	find . -name 'hello' -exec chmod 660 {} \;

Job control (uses fg, bg and jobs builtins).


What doesn't work yet?
===

Globbing, brace expansion, exit code logic, environment variables... (you get
the idea).
