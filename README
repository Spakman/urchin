Urchin
===

A Unix shell for Ruby programmers. If you have any ideas for what you think
this should mean, please let me know!

So far there is working job control, redirections, tilde expansion, aliasing,
globbing and environment variables.

Preparing for 0.1.0
===

Urchin has met my criteria for a first release (used as my login shell for a
week without breaking or annoying me)!

Now mostly ready for a first release, mainly just some tidying up and
refactoring to do.


What won't be in 0.1.0
---
* Anything more than the Readline provided tab-completion
* Exit code logic
* Anymore more than really basic persistent history
* Any Urchin installation packages


Requirements
===

Ruby
---
Tested with CRuby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2. If running using 1.9.2 on a laptop, be aware
of bug #3436 (http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/3436).

Readline support of some variety is needed. I've only really tested with GNU
Readline on Linux. Users of editline, rb-readline, RawLine, etc are welcome to
report/fix bugs!


ruby-termios
---
Tested with version 0.9.6.

Using via Rubygems is discouraged to save memory, but will work.


Some examples that work
===

Pipelines:

	ls -la | head -n2

Redirecting STDOUT, STDIN, STDERR:

	uptime > output
	uptime >> output
	ruby -e 'puts STDIN.read; STDERR.puts 33' < input > out_and_err 2>&1

Backgrounding jobs:

	sleep 60 &

Multiple jobs:

	sleep 60 & man sleep

	sleep 60; echo "it's over"

Quoted and unquoted parameters:

	grep -r '"hello"' .
	grep -r "\"hello\"" .
	ls my\ annoyingly\ named\ dir
	find . -name 'hello' -exec chmod 660 {} \;

Globbing:

	ls **/*.rb
	mv image?.{png,gif} images

Tilde expansion:

	ls ~/src/
	ls ~mark

Reading and setting environment variables:

	echo $PATH
	echo abx${HOME}xyz
	export HELLO="Yo man!"

Job control (uses fg, bg and jobs builtins).
