A Unix shell for Ruby programmers. If you have any ideas for what you think
this should mean, please let me know!

Regard this as very incomplete and experimental for now!

Requirements
===

Ruby - tested with CRuby 1.8.6 and 1.9.2. If running using 1.9.2 on a laptop,
be aware of bug #3436 (http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/3436).

Termios - using via Rubygems is discouraged to save memory.


What works?
===

Pipelines:

	ls -la | head -n2

Redirecting STDOUT, STDIN, STDERR:

	uptime > output
	uptime >> output
	ruby -e 'puts STDIN.read; STDERR.puts 33' < input > out_and_err 2>&1

Backgrounding jobs:

	sleep 60 &

Multiple jobs:

	sleep 60 & man sleep

	sleep 60; echo "it's over"

Quoted and unquoted parameters:

	grep -r '"hello"' .
	grep -r "\"hello\"" .
	ls my\ annoyingly\ named\ dir
	find . -name 'hello' -exec chmod 660 {} \;

Globbing:

	ls **/*.rb
	mv image?.{png,gif} images

Job control (uses fg, bg and jobs builtins).


What doesn't work yet?
===

Exit code logic, environment variables, tilde expansion... (you get the idea).
